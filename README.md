# Project 1: Analysing Agricultural Data of Cornbelt Region.

## Overview:

### Aims of the project:
a) To visualize and analyze agricultural data of each states across Cornbelt Region:
- the studied farm area (km2), 
- land utillized for planting and harvesting (ha)
- 2 different crop yield (kg/ha)
- estimates topsoil loss (km2)

b) To investigate the relationship between topsoil loss (ha) and yield reduction while reflects the economic loss (usd).

This project

## Problem Statement
Eroded soil reduced crop yield and lead to economic loss.

## Datasets
- topsoil_loss.csv: agricultural data of Cornbelt Region [(source)] (https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1774)

## Key Takeaaways:
1. Topsoil loss had affected the crop yield negatively and led to economic loss.

## Conclusion:

Soil conservation practices must be performed to mitigate the issue of reduced crop yield and avoid more economic loss. 
(e. g.: Terracing, cover crop, mulching)

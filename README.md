# Project 1: Analysing Agricultural Data of Cornbelt Region.

## Overview:

Topsoil is the uppermost layer of soil that provides the most nutrients for the crop. Reduced topsoil layer will definitely affects the yield of the crop. Thus, resulting in economic loss too.

This dataset includes information at count- and state-level across the Corn Belt region.

### Aims of the project:
a) To visualize and analyze agricultural data of each states across Cornbelt Region:
- the studied farm area (km2), 
- land utillized for planting and harvesting (ha)
- 2 different crop yield (kg/ha)
- estimates topsoil loss (km2)

b) To investigate the relationship between topsoil loss (ha) and yield reduction while reflects the economic loss (usd).

## Problem Statement
Eroded soil reduced crop yield then led to economic loss.

## Datasets
- topsoil_loss.csv: agricultural data of Cornbelt Region. Source: https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1774

## Key Takeaaways:
1. Topsoil loss had affected the crop yield negatively and led to economic loss.

## Conclusion:

Soil conservation practices must be performed to mitigate the issue of reduced crop yield and avoid more economic loss. 
(e. g.: Terracing, cover crop, mulching)
